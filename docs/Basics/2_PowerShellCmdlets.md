# PowerShell Cmdlets

---

Cmdlets are the basic building blocks of PowerShell scripts. They are pre-built commands that perform a specific task or action. Cmdlets are structured with a verb-noun naming convention and are easy to remember.

Here are some basic cmdlets in PowerShell:

1. **Get-Command**: This cmdlet is used to retrieve a list of all the available cmdlets in PowerShell. This is useful for finding the right cmdlet to perform a specific task.

2. **Get-Help**: This cmdlet is used to display help and usage information for a specific cmdlet. The command "Get-Help" can be followed by the name of the cmdlet you want to learn about. For example, "Get-Help Get-ChildItem".

3. **Get-Process**: This cmdlet is used to retrieve a list of all the running processes on the system. This is useful for troubleshooting issues with specific processes or identifying resource usage.

4. **Set-ExecutionPolicy**: This cmdlet is used to configure the PowerShell execution policy, which controls the level of security for running scripts in PowerShell. This is important for preventing malicious or unauthorized scripts from running on a system.

5. **New-Item**: This cmdlet is used to create a new item, such as a file or directory, in a specified location. This is useful for automating the creation of files and folders.

6. **Copy-Item**: This cmdlet is used to copy files and directories from one location to another. This is useful for backing up files or moving data between locations.

7. **Remove-Item**: This cmdlet is used to delete files and directories from a specified location. This is useful for cleaning up unnecessary files or freeing up disk space.

These are just a few examples of the basic cmdlets available in PowerShell. There are many more cmdlets available for a wide range of tasks and functions. By combining cmdlets with parameters and operators, PowerShell provides a powerful tool for automating tasks and managing systems.
