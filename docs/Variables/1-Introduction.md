# Introduction to PS Variables

---

PowerShell variables are a fundamental concept in scripting that allow you to store and manipulate data in your scripts. A variable is simply a named container that can hold a value, such as a string, integer, or boolean. PowerShell supports several different types of variables, including scalar variables, arrays, hash tables, and environment variables, each with its own unique properties and uses.

Variables in PowerShell are especially useful when you need to store and reuse data across different parts of your script or across different script executions. For example, you might use variables to store user input, results from a command, or a calculated value. PowerShell variables also support basic manipulation such as concatenation, substitution, and splitting/joining.

In addition to the different types of variables, PowerShell also has various scopes for variables that determine where and how the variable can be accessed. Understanding variable scope is an important part of working with PowerShell variables.

Overall, understanding how to create, manipulate, and manage variables is an essential skill for any PowerShell user, whether you're a beginner or an experienced scripter.
