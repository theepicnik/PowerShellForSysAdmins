# Error Handling

---

In PowerShell, error handling is the process of identifying and managing errors that occur during script execution. PowerShell provides several ways to handle errors, including built-in error handling functionality and custom error handling mechanisms.

PowerShell's built-in error handling functionality allows you to trap and handle errors that occur during script execution. The most common way to handle errors is by using the Try...Catch...Finally statement, which allows you to catch and handle specific types of errors that might occur.

Here's an example of using Try...Catch...Finally to handle errors:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
```powershell
Try {
    # some code that might cause an error
}
Catch {
    # code to handle the error
}
Finally {
    # code to execute after the Try or Catch block
}
```
</div>

In this example, the Try block contains the code that might cause an error. If an error occurs, the Catch block is executed, where you can handle the error in a way that makes sense for your script. **The Finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.**

PowerShell also provides several other ways to handle errors, including the Trap statement, which allows you to catch and handle all errors that occur within a script, and the `$Error` variable, which contains information about the most recent error that occurred.

Effective error handling is critical to the success of any PowerShell script. By properly handling errors, you can ensure that your scripts are robust and reliable, and can recover gracefully from unexpected errors.
