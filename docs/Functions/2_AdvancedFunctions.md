# Advanced function features

---

PowerShell functions can have several advanced features that can make them more powerful and efficient. Some of these features include:

1. **Parameter validation**: PowerShell allows you to validate the parameters passed to a function to ensure they meet certain criteria. This can help prevent errors and improve the reliability of your code.

2. **Pipeline support**: Functions can be designed to accept input from the pipeline, allowing you to use them in conjunction with other cmdlets and functions.

3. **Error handling**: Functions can have built-in error handling that allows you to gracefully handle errors and exceptions that may occur during execution.

4. **Parameter sets**: You can define multiple parameter sets for a function, allowing it to accept different combinations of parameters depending on how it is used.

5. **Help documentation**: PowerShell functions can include help documentation that describes their purpose, usage, and parameters. This can be extremely helpful when working with functions that are new or unfamiliar.

Using these advanced features can help you create more powerful and flexible functions that can be used in a variety of scenarios.
