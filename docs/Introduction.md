# Introduction to PowerShell

---

**PowerShell** is a command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is designed to automate administrative tasks and system management, allowing administrators to manage and configure computers from the command line rather than using graphical interfaces. PowerShell is based on the .NET Framework, and as such it provides access to a wide range of system administration tasks and APIs.

PowerShell uses a command-line interface similar to the Windows Command Prompt, but with several key differences. PowerShell commands, called cmdlets, are designed to be easy to use and consistent across different modules and scripts. Cmdlets are typically written in C# or another .NET language and are loaded into PowerShell when needed.

PowerShell also includes a powerful scripting language that allows administrators to automate complex tasks and create reusable scripts. The scripting language supports variables, loops, functions, and other programming constructs, and it can be used to interact with a wide range of system components and services.

Overall, PowerShell provides a powerful and flexible environment for system administrators to manage and automate their Windows, Linux, and macOS systems.
