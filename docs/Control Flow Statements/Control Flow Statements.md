# Control flow statements

---

Control flow statements in PowerShell are used to control the flow of execution of a script. They allow you to make decisions based on conditions, repeat blocks of code, and jump to different parts of a script based on specific conditions.

The most common control flow statements in PowerShell are:

1. **If statements** - Used to execute code if a condition is true and skip the code if the condition is false.
2. **Switch statements** - Used to execute code based on the value of a variable or expression.
3. **For loops** - Used to execute a block of code a specific number of times.
4. **While loops** - Used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.
5. **Do-While loops** - Similar to While loops, but the code block is executed at least once before the condition is evaluated.
6. **ForEach-Object** - Used to iterate over a collection of objects and perform a specific action on each object.
